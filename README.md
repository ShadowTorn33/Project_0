# Tamagotchi Game

## Overview
#### Creating a Tamagachi with:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
```
In this priject-0, I have made a Tamagachi Pet game. You can give your pet a name within the text field.
-There are 3 buttons in which you can interact with the page.
-One of the buttons is for playing with your pet, another is for feeding your pet, and the last one 
is for putting your pet to bed or letting them rest.
-If at any point your pets hunger,boredom,or sleep level hits 10, your pet will die.
-If your pet dies you will be alerted and can restart your game.
